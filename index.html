        <h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
        Following my initial questions, I detail my explorations below. Note
        that I use property type and usage type interchangeably.

        I first explored the prices of all properties within Boston, from
        residential to general office space. The concentration of condominium
        housing along the Newbury Street and Beacon Street area matches
        expectations of expensive housing in Back Bay like the brownstones. The
        concentration of general office spaces in the Financial Districts is
        also expected.

        </figure>
        Condominiums and general office space seem to dominate the value of
        properties in Boston. But since there are many types of properties
        unrelated to residential types, I filtered them out for the following
        visualizations and only included #-family homes, condominiums, and
        subsidized housing (as well as merged similar usages: ex. CONDOMINIUM
        and CONDO BLDG).
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/avg_price_housing_by_type_loc.png"
            alt=""
            width="700px"
          />

            Boston.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        In this visualization, I explored the average annual value of each
        property related to residential housing (family homes, condominiums,
        apartments, and subsidized housing) in Boston. Condominiums dominate the
        the value percentage of the housing, as discussed in the "Towers of
        Wealth" article. While anaylzing the relevant data, I found that each
        address, particularly those for apartments and condominiums, listed the
        units separately and by number. Furthermore, there existed some
        duplicates. Therefore, I took the median of the price for each property
        to get a reflection of the price for a unit at a given address and
        removed duplicates. However, I wondered how different types of
        residential housing compared in terms of lot size.

          <figcaption>Average lot size of housing in Boston.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        Here, condominiums (yellow) dominate in terms of lot size, which aligns
        with expectations from the article readings and this report
        (https://www.bostonplans.org/getattachment/62f2b1bf-c8b3-434b-89e4-ea8f5c8508b4#:~:text=Apartment%20buildings%20account%20for%209,of%20residential%20land%20in%20Boston.)

          <figcaption>Average price of condominiums over time.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        In the above visualization, we can see that the average price of condos
        has increased dramatically over time. However, what is the number of
        properties built by type and what are the trends with respect to time of
        how many buildings of each residential type were built?
        <figure>
          <img src="images/num_props.png" alt="" width="400px" />
          <figcaption>Number of buildings built by usage type.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        I noticed that condominiums consist of the most number of buildings
        within Boston, along with single-family homes and general offices.
        <figure>
          <img src="images/num_props_time_nulls.png" alt="" width="700px" />
          <img src="images/num_props_time.png" alt="" width="700px" />

            removed data for comparison.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        When I analyzed the data for year in which each residential property was
        built in Boston, there were properties that were built in year 0 or
        null. I removed those data points and updated my previous visualization
        to maintain consistency. The general trend seems to be the increasing
        construction of condominiums within Boston compared to other housing
        types, particularly starting in 1920.
        <figure>
          <img src="images/mortgage.png" alt="" width="200px" />
          <figcaption>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        When analyzing the mortgages of family homes, single-family homes have
        the highest range and a larger median mortgage. Note that I did remove
        data points with mortgages of 0. However, who is investing in all these
        properties?
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/num_cash_sales_investor_type.png"
            alt=""
            width="400px"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Average number of cash sales per investor by usage type.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        I notice that institutional investors and investors are able to, on
        average, purchase more cash sales than non-investors. This is likely due
        to the fact that investors have an advantage in the housing market.
        <figure>
          <img src="images/investor_types_loc.png" alt="" width="700px" />

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>
      Similarly to the above. Investors dominate most of the cash sale purchases
      in Boston, particularly institutional, large, and small investors.

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>
          Condominiums have been on the rise in construction and the recent
          housing market and take a majority share in the value. Property prices have expectedly increased over time. Investors are
          also more likely than non-investors to make cash sale purchases.
          Housing such as condos and more expensive homes are located primarily
          in the Back Bay area compared to the rest of the Boston neighborhoods.
